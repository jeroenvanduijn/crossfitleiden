      "q1": "Am I fit enough to start CrossFit?",
      "a1": "Absolutely! You don't need to be fit to start. 80% of our members had no sports experience when they started. We adjust every exercise to your level – whether you haven't exercised in 20 years or are quite active.",
      "q2": "How often should I come?",
      "a2": "We recommend 2–3 times per week for good results. How often you can come depends on your membership: up to 6 times per week. Focus on quality and consistency, not extreme hours.",
      "q3": "Isn't CrossFit dangerous? I don't want injuries...",
      "a3p1": "Understandable concern! But precisely because of our coaching, CrossFit is much safer than working out alone. We teach you the right technique with light weights first. Only when your movement is good do we progress. Injury prevention is our priority.",
      "a3p2": "We partner with Fysiofabriek, a professional physiotherapy practice with their own treatment room in our gym. This allows us to act quickly with aches, rehabilitation or advice.",
      "q4": "Am I not too old to start?",
      "a4": "Not at all! Our members are between 20 and 65 years old, with most between 35-50. CrossFit is perfect for \"older\" beginners because we adjust everything to your body and goals. You're never too old to get stronger and healthier!",
      "q5": "I really don't have time, with work and kids...",
      "a5": "We understand! That's why our classes last exactly 1 hour (including warm-up and cool-down). Our classes run from 06:00 to 22:00, so there's always a time that fits. Many members come before work, during lunch break or in the evening when the kids are in bed.",
      "q6": "What happens during the Free Intro?",
      "a6": "The intro lasts 20-30 minutes. We get to know you, talk about your goals and concerns, show you the box and answer all your questions. You do NOT have to work out during this intro – just getting to know each other. Afterwards we create a plan together if you want to continue. No commitments, no pressure!"

      "q3": "Which class should I choose?",

      "p1": "We're not your typical gym. CrossFit Leiden was founded on a simple idea: <strong>everyone should feel welcome to exercise</strong>, regardless of age, fitness level, or experience.",
      "p2": "No macho culture or intimidating atmosphere. Here you train alongside parents who come after putting the kids to bed, young professionals who come before work, students picking up a barbell for the first time, expats looking for a new community, and people who haven't exercised in 10 or 20 years. Members specifically training for Hyrox or seeking extra challenge also find their place here. <strong>Everyone starts somewhere</strong>, and we'll help you along the way.",
      "p3": "We understand how it feels to have doubts: \"Am I fit enough?\", \"Do I have time?\", \"Will I fit in?\" The answer is always: <strong>yes!</strong> Our community is built on support, not judgment. Here we know each other's names, celebrate each other's successes (big or small), and encourage each other.",
      "p4": "We don't just train in the gym. We also tackle challenges together outside the box: Hyrox events, runs, outdoor challenges, and trips. The gym is the means, but the goal is for you to stand stronger and more confident in your life."

    "story": {
      "title": "The story behind CrossFit Leiden",
      "p1": "I'm Jeroen, founder of CrossFit Leiden.",
      "p2": "Before I started this gym, I worked in an office as a business controller at Samsung. I sat behind a desk all day, felt increasingly unfit, gained weight, and noticed my confidence slowly fading. I wasn't deeply unhappy, but I felt very clearly: this isn't for me.",
      "p3": "Around 2013, I saw a video online of someone doing CrossFit. Someone training with complete confidence. I felt immediately: that's what I'm missing. Shortly after, I started training, first at CrossFit Bink and later at Gymbox Noordwijk. Slowly everything changed. I got stronger, fitter, and especially much more confident in my body. That energy also spread to my girlfriend, now my wife.",
      "p4": "At a certain point I knew: I don't just want to improve numbers in Excel, I want to help people feel better in their own bodies. In 2016, together with Kees Houwaart, owner of Gymbox Noordwijk, I started CrossFit Leiden.",
      "p5": "Since then, we've been able to help over 3,000 people. We've learned so much, heard so many stories, and built a community that I'm proud to walk into every day.",
      "p6": "Now I'm a father of two children and I see even more clearly how important it is for people to stay strong and healthy. We live in a time when we need builders: people with energy, resilience, and joy in what they do. I want CrossFit Leiden to be a positive beacon in the city. A place where energy starts and spreads to families, businesses, and the streets of Leiden.",
      "p7": "That's why our mission is very concrete: over the next ten years, we want to help about ten people start safely in Leiden every month. That's about 120 new members per year, and ultimately around 1,200 families and approximately 4,800 people we help to stand stronger, more positive, and more energetic in life.",
      "p8": "We don't do this with quick tricks, but with good coaching, a strong community, and workouts you can sustain. In the gym we build strength and confidence, so you dare more outside: tackle new challenges, go on adventures, grow professionally, or simply run after your kids with joy again.",
      "p9": "CrossFit Leiden is the means for that. A second living room where you feel seen, where you get to know each other, and where you walk out a little stronger every week than you walked in."
