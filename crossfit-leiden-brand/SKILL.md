# CrossFit Leiden Brand Guidelines

Apply CrossFit Leiden's brand identity when creating any content for the gym including marketing materials, social media, documents, presentations, and communications.

## Core Brand Identity

### Who We Are
CrossFit Leiden is not a standard gym. We are a second home for parents, a community for expats, and a place where people leave fitter and happier than they arrived. We focus on training for real life, not just for training's sake.

### Brand Values
- **Personal**: Everyone is seen and coached with attention
- **Accessible**: Everyone can participate, we attract life-enjoyers not just athletes  
- **Friendly**: Warm, honest, with humor
- **Leadership with a smile**: Expert but relaxed
- **Adventurous**: We live outside the box (literally)
- **Sustainable**: Building habits that last

## Tone of Voice

### Personality
Think of us as **the good friend** who remembers your name and pushes you just enough, **the guide** who explains without being preachy, **the mood maker** who makes everyone feel at home, and **the adventurer** who invites you to step outside your comfort zone.

### Language Style
- Informal, positive, expert
- Short sentences, active voice, not too formal
- Conversational language and humor where appropriate
- Use CrossFit terms but explain them and keep it accessible
- Never say "athlete", use "members", "community" or "people"
- Never use em-dashes
- Occasional emoji - but always functional, never decorative

### Example Phrases
- "Not training to train, but training for the life outside"
- "Today muscle pain. Tomorrow pride"
- "You come in tired, you leave proud"
- "New habits start here - with a smile, not with stress"

## Visual Identity

### Color Usage
When creating visual content, use the brand colors:

**Primary Colors:**
- Cinnabar (coral red): #EF4C37 - Main brand color, energetic and warm
- White: #FFFFFF - Primary background and text
- Black: #000000 - Text and contrast

**Secondary Color:**
- Jonquil (yellow): #F7CB15 - Accent and energy

**Tertiary Colors:**
- Verdigris (teal): #0CBABA - Fresh, outdoor feeling
- Chinese Violet (purple): #7B6D8D - Depth and sophistication

**Color Proportions:**
Use Cinnabar as the dominant color (largest areas), Jonquil and White/Black for secondary areas, and Verdigris/Chinese Violet as accent colors.

### Typography
- **Display/Headlines**: Heading Now Medium (bold, impactful)
- **Subheadings**: Suisse Int'l Bold  
- **Body Text**: Suisse Int'l Regular
- **Buttons/CTAs**: Suisse Int'l Regular (uppercase for hierarchy 1, regular case for hierarchy 2)

### Graphic Elements
The brand uses geometric diamond shapes created from a 45° rotated grid. These can be used as:
- Background patterns
- Accent elements
- Photo frames or overlays
- Dividers

Keep shapes clean, geometric, and aligned to the grid system.

### Logo Usage
- Use the full isologotype (circular logo with text) for most applications
- Use the simplified version (with partial circle arcs) for medium sizes
- Use the icon only (crossed barbells) when the brand is already established in context
- Monochrome (black) on light backgrounds, inverted (white) on dark backgrounds

## Content Types

### Marketing & Social Media
Read [references/social-media-guidelines.md](references/social-media-guidelines.md) for:
- Post structures and formats
- Image composition guidelines  
- Story templates

### Community & Culture
The gym culture includes:
- Annual events: Murph, New Year's Eve WOD, CrossFit Open, Ardennes trip
- Challenges: Paris-Leiden cycling, 12km sandbag carry
- Regular events: Hyrox simulations, Run Swim Run, 8-week courses

Reference these naturally when they're relevant to content.

### Target Audience

- International, highly educated  
- Not competitive, but committed
- Seeking community and lifestyle
- Many are beginners or returnees looking for confidence and structure
