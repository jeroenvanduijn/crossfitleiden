# CrossFit Leiden Social Media Guidelines

Guidelines for creating social media content that aligns with CrossFit Leiden's brand identity.

## Grid System and Safe Spaces

### Instagram Post (1:1 - 1080x1080px)
- **Grid**: 5 columns
- **Safe space margins**: 
  - Top: 100px
  - Bottom: 150px
  - Left/Right: 90px
- Keep critical text and logo within safe spaces

### Instagram Story / Reel (9:16 - 1080x1920px)
- **Grid**: Use vertical alignment
- **Safe space margins**:
  - Top: 150px (profile name area)
  - Bottom: 140px (interactive elements area)
  - Left/Right: Use column grid

### YouTube / Horizontal (16:9 - 1920x1080px)
- **Grid**: 9 columns
- **Safe space margins**:
  - Top/Bottom: 150px
  - Left/Right: 140px

## Visual Composition

### Color Usage
Follow the brand color proportions:
- **Cinnabar (#EF4C37)**: Largest areas, dominant presence
- **White/Black**: Secondary areas, text
- **Jonquil (#F7CB15)**: Accent elements
- **Verdigris/Chinese Violet**: Smaller accent touches

### Graphic Elements
Use the 45° diamond shapes from the brand identity:
- As background patterns
- Photo frames or masks
- Accent elements around text
- Dividers between content sections

**Important**: Keep shapes clean and geometric. They should feel intentional, not random.

### Logo Placement
- **1:1 Posts**: Bottom left corner within safe space
- **Stories**: Top left or bottom left, small
- **Cover images**: Top right or incorporated into design
- Use monochrome (black) on light backgrounds, inverted (white) on dark backgrounds

## Post Types and Templates

### 1. Testimonial Posts

**1:1 Format:**
- Large photo of the member (action shot or portrait)
- Overlay geometric shapes in brand colors
- Quote overlaid on image in white text
- Member name below quote
- Logo in bottom corner

**Story Format:**
- Full-screen photo with teal/coral geometric accents
- Quote in large text (Heading Now Medium)
- Member name
- Swipe-up/interactive elements at bottom

### 2. Campaign/Message Posts

**Key Visual Style:**
- Bold typography (Heading Now Medium for headlines)
- Large geometric shapes as design elements
- High contrast (Cinnabar on white, or white on dark photos)
- Clear hierarchy with Suisse Int'l for supporting text

**Example Headlines:**
- "YOUR ROAD TO FEELING GREAT"
- "EVERYDAY PEOPLE, EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG"

**Structure:**
- Main headline (large, impactful)
- Supporting text (optional, smaller)
- Call to action
- Logo and URL (crossfitleiden.com)

### 3. Trainer Introductions

**1:1 Format:**
- Professional but approachable photo
- Name and role
- Can include geometric shapes sparingly
- Introduction in caption, not on image

**Story Format:**
- Closer crop, personality-focused
- Minimal text overlay (just name if any)
- Story told in caption or text

### 4. Service/Program Announcements

**Visual Treatment:**
- Icon from brand iconography (6x6 grid style)
- Service name
- Brief description or CTA
- Background: Solid color (Jonquil, Cinnabar, or White) or photo with overlay

### 5. Event/Challenge Posts

**Approach:**
- Action photos from actual events
- Overlay brand graphics subtly
- Focus on community and energy
- Can be more dynamic with composition

## Content Patterns

### Captions

**Structure:**
1. Hook (first line - engaging opener)
2. Story or context
3. Value or takeaway
4. Call to action (if appropriate)
5. Hashtags (separate section at end)

**Length:**
- Instagram: 150-300 characters ideal for engagement
- Longer posts (up to 2000) for stories and announcements
- Keep first 2 lines strong (before "...more")

**Example Caption:**
```
Je komt moe binnen. Je gaat trots weer naar huis. 💪
